## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to report it through our GitHub bug report system. Please follow the steps below to ensure that your report is handled efficiently:

1. **Submit the Report**: Open a new issue on our GitHub repository in the [Issues](https://github.com/yourproject/issues) section. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Any relevant logs or error messages
   - Affected versions of the software

2. **Acknowledgment**: Once your report is submitted, we will acknowledge it within 3 workdays via GitHub comments. You will be informed that we have started investigating the issue.

3. **Investigation and Resolution**: Our team will evaluate the severity of the vulnerability and prioritize it accordingly. You can expect an update on the status of your report within 7-10 days. If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix and provide you with an estimated timeline for a patch.

4. **Public Disclosure**: If the vulnerability is accepted and fixed, we will release a security update and publicly disclose the details, crediting the reporter (unless the reporter wishes to remain anonymous). If the vulnerability is declined or not reproducible, we will inform you of the decision and provide any relevant feedback.

5. **Confidentiality**: We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability to the public until the issue has been resolved to avoid potential exploitation.

Thank you for helping us improve the security of our project!
