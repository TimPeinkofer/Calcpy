## Cubic Spline Interpolation

This project implements a **cubic spline interpolation** algorithm in Python using **NumPy**.  
The algorithm constructs and solves a linear system to determine the spline coefficients, allowing smooth interpolation of a given function across a set of points.

### Functions

#### 1. `h(i, x)`
Computes the step size between two adjacent points.  
- **Args:**  
  - `i`: Index  
  - `x`: Array of grid points  
- **Returns:**  
  - Step size `x[i+1] - x[i]`  

---

#### 2. `cubic_splines(n, x, func)`
Constructs cubic splines for interpolation.  
- **Args:**  
  - `n`: Number of intervals (`len(x) - 1`)  
  - `x`: Array of grid points of length `n+1`  
  - `func`: Function to evaluate at grid points  
- **Returns:**  
  - `matrix`: Coefficient matrix of the linear system  
  - `vec`: Right-hand side vector  
  - `solution`: Approximated spline second derivatives (including boundary conditions)  

---

### Algorithm Details

1. **Initialization**  
   - Evaluate the function values at the given grid points.  
   - Construct the system matrix and vector based on spline conditions.  

2. **Interior Equations**  
   - Ensure smoothness of the cubic spline (continuity of first and second derivatives).  

3. **Boundary Conditions**  
   - Natural spline end conditions are implemented via extended system equations.  

4. **Solve System**  
   - Solve `matrix * solution = vec`.  
   - Extend solution to include boundary second derivatives `S_0` and `S_n`.  

5. **Conditioning Check**  
   - If the system matrix is ill-conditioned (`cond(matrix) > 1e12`), a warning is raised.

## Boundary Value Problem Solver

This project implements two numerical methods for solving boundary value problems (BVPs) of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):  

- **Finite Difference Method** (Matrix Method)  
- **Shooting Method**

The implementation is based on **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**.  
Additionally, helper functions `runge_kutta` (for solving ODEs) and `linear_interpolation` (for root finding) are imported from external modules (`ODE.py`, `NonLinEq.py`).
